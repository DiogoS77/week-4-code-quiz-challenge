## Description

This project is a creation of a code quiz. This quiz contains a total of 5 questions that can be found when you start it. This quiz was build from the beggining and the main focus was to make a clean and simple designed quiz. This page contains three javascript files , three css files and two html files.

The biggest challenge i found was the order from where i should start since there was no starter code on this challenge. It took me sometime to know form where i should start to make everything the most organised and correct way.
I think making this quiz is really important for self improvment because this was probably the most challenging challenge i had untill now.

This challenge helped me a lot because it made me my way of thinking change since there was so much stuff to do complete to make the quiz work. I will be listing bellow some improtant points that this challenge helped me with.

- How to organise myself
- Define the starting point
- Better understanding of working with multiple files
- Improvment in working speed
